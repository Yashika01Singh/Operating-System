File A.c 
 This contains the function A which take a number input from user then pass it to function B.

File main.asm
 This contains the function which has an integer passed parameter stored in rdi,
 There is a while loop which moves value of dil register in var and store it in stack 
 which is then popped to rdi and printed using write system call, dil register stores the last 8 bits of rdi.
 We then right shift rdi by 8 bits using shr rdi,8 . 
 ALso we push and pop rdi in the stack as while printing value of rdi gets changed so we do this to save the earlier value. 
 Then at last we move address of extern function c in r8 
 and pop rcx and push r8 to alter the return address so the function return to c()

File C.c
This contains the function C which is called by B() , 
this prints “This is C” to ensure we have reached C then it exits.


input : an integer
Execute instuction : make run   to run the whole program

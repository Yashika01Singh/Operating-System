# Operating-System Assignment 1

Question 1 :
    Run Command  : 
    chmod +x q1.sh 
    ./q1.sh "input in DD MM YYYY format"
        
    Input        : input in DD MM YYYY format passed as command line argument
    Sample run command :
    chmod +x q1.sh 
    ./q1.sh 01 05 2002

Question 2 :
    
    Run Command  : 
    chmod +x q2.sh 
    ./q2.sh "operator <space seperated integer array >"

    Input : operator - add sub div or exp
            multiple integers
    Sample Input : add 2 3 4
    Output : first given operation is performed on first two integers,
             then operation is performed on this result and next number and it goes on
             For eg: exp 2 4 1 
                   = (2^4)^1

Question 3 :
    part a : Binary Tree
    Run Command  : make q3_01
    Input : According to prompt one integer at a time
    Sample Input :
    1
    2
    1
    3
    4
    
    output => According to selected operation

    part b: AVL Tree
    Run Command  : make q3_02
    Input : According to prompt one integer at a time
    Sample Input :
    1
    2
    1
    6
    2
    6
    4
    

Question 4 :

    Run command : make q4

    input : one integer 1 for selection sort 2 for Bubble sort
    integer corresponding to number of elements, array of these many elements

    Sample Input :
